# PixStor Search Plugin

**Name:** videobarcode.py

## About This Plugin

This plugin provides an alternative proxy generator for video files. It creates a 'barcode' visualisation of a video file.

![Example Barcode](example_barcode.png "Example Barcode")

The 'barcode' works by extracting frames from the video, calculating the average colour of the frames, then creating an image from bars of those colours.
The resulting visualisation gives a sense of the colours used in the video, and how those colours change across the duration of the video.

The method for creating these visualisations was inspired by an article from [pyimagesearch](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/01/16/generating-movie-barcodes-with-opencv-and-python/)

Because the process of generating these visualisations is heavy-weight, the plugin is asynchronous, handing-off the processing to the job engine (HTCondor by default).


## Installing This Plugin

1. Download the plugin to your 'available plugins' directory

``` shell
wget -P /opt/arcapix/usr/share/apsearch/plugins/available/arcapix-community-extras \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcapix/pixstor-search-plugins/master/community/videobarcode/videobarcode.py
```

2. Symlink the plugin to the 'enabled plugins' directory

``` shell
ln -s /opt/arcapix/usr/share/apsearch/plugins/available/arcapix-community-extras/videobarcode.py \
    /opt/arcapix/usr/share/apsearch/plugins/enabled
```

3. Restart the `apsearch-middleware` service:

``` shell
systemctl restart apsearch-middleware
```

4. (Re)ingest content as required - existing data will not be automatically rescanned


The plugin uses the python libraries [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [storyboard](https://github.com/zmwangx/storyboard).
These should have already been installed along with PixStor Search


## Using This Plugin

This plugin could be used as an alternative to the standard screencap-based thumbnails generated by default for video files.

At present, images generated by this plugin won't be displayed in the standard PixStor Search UI


The plugin also provides a commandline interface so barcodes can be generated directly

```
$ python videobarcode.py -h

usage: videobarcode.py <source> <target>
                       -W WIDTH -H HEIGHT [--max-frames MAX_FRAMES]
                       [--min-bar-width MIN_BAR_WIDTH] [--force-size]
```
