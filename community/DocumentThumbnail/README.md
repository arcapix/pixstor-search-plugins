## About This Plugin

This plugin generates thumbnail and preview images for document file formats - including PDF and Word

![Example PDF Thumbnail](example_pdf_thumbnail.png "Example PDF Thumbnail")

## Deprecated and Removed

This plugin used `unoconv` to generate its thumbnails. However, this command has been observed to fail (become 'defunct'), causing ingest to hang indefinitely.

As such, this plugin has been removed, and we recommended it be deleted from any system it has been installed on.
Any issues relating to the continued use of this plugin are considered unsupported.
