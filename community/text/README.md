## About This Plugin

The `TextPlugin` extracted various attributes of a text - word count, a list of 20 commonly used words, and the language of the text.

Note - this plugin is very inefficient. It attempts to read a whole text into memory to perform its processing.
For large files, it is likely to be very slow and memory inefficient.


## Deprecated and Removed

This plugin is no longer compatible PixStor Search, and installing it will cause PixStor systems to fail to operate correctly. 

As such, it has been removed, and should be deleted from any system it has been installed on prior to updating to recent versions of PixStor Search.
